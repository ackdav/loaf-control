notes: 'Random walk experiment: 100g rye (23.5%), 80g whole grain (19%), 75% hydration.
  Dough very sticky during mixing, different handling than wheat doughs. 3 coil folds
  (not stretch-and-fold). Bake: 22min covered 250C, then 4min uncovered 230C, 14.5min
  uncovered 220C (dropped temp), 8min oven-off. Used foil to protect ear which sprung
  dramatically. Bake loss 7.2% vs loaf 7 10.3% - possibly slightly underbaked. Lighter
  color than expected.'
