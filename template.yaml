# Sentinel value: -1 means "not tracked/measured" (vs 0 which means "actually zero/skipped")
# Run `make calculate` to auto-fill derived fields (hydration_pct, inoculation_pct, etc)

# QUALITY SCALE (compare to YOUR previous bakes):
# 1 = inedible/failure
# 2 = edible but poor (dense, gummy, or burnt)
# 3 = acceptable daily bread
# 4 = good, would be happy to serve guests
# 5 = best you've made so far
